                        I am Josh, resident of South Eastern Wisconsin.  I've had my fair share of near misses and stressful scenarios as a pedestrian and driver, and I dedicated this project to explain how safety of driving in this area is struggling and what local governments have done in the past and will do for the future.
                        <br><br>
                        Driving is the way to live your life throughout the country.  You drive to get groceries, drive to school, drive to work, drive to the doctor, and drive to do anything, really.  You drive to live.
                        <br><br>
                        During my high school years, that I’ve walked along a sidewalk to reach the school’s parking lot.  Unfortunately, there is only one way in and out of the parking lot, which is of course intersects the sidewalk.  Cars bolt to and from the parking lot directly into a rather busy Highway 45.  There were no crossing guards, just a dinky stop sign that impatient students see as visual noise.  There were two instances where I was inches away from an unaware driver when walking on that damn sidewalk.  One of which if I was a second ahead, my foot would have been run over!  Thankfully, I had the luck to remain unscathed, but not everyone is as lucky.
                        <br><br>
                        I was not the only one to express concerns about the lack of safety and regulations regarding driving.  Over the past five years, local governments throughout southeastern Wisconsin have made big strides to help address pedestrian safety.
                        <br><br>
                        This is not to discourage the use of cars.  Living here would be impossible and impractical if personal vehicles magically disappeared.  The best we can do is spread awareness and continue to pass stronger traffic laws to reduce the risk of accidents.
